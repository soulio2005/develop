        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Mohammad Rasoul Fard-Habibi, the reason for starting coding is because I have a few apps I want
            to pursue, mostly in Kotlin.I got into coding and website design by first using Wordpress. I started
            developing my skills more with YouTube and FreeCodeCamp.Then I got the opportunity with Codenation. With
            Codenation I did the 3 week develop course which included Javascript,IOS development. In the final week we
            are doing HTML,CSS building our website.On a personal note I enjoy volunteering, Iâ€™ve volunteered in Uganda
            teaching maths and English and Morocco. I also volunteered at Scope Chester to secure my Health and Social
            care Level 3.

        IOS,HTML5,CSS and Javascript. The course has been great and my coding knowledge has been enhanced.
