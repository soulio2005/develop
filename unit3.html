<p><b>Unit 2, Outcome 3 (Review)</b></p>

<p><b>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </b></p>

<p>Visual Studio
VS code is fantastic tool to write HTML5 and CSS, I have found it to be easy to pick up and the live updates are great to check your work on the fly. Debugging functions are brilliant for easily identifying any problems with your code.Visual studio is also customisable and you can download third-party extensions which are massively helpful.</p>
<p>
Trello 
Trello has been great, using the cards to keep an I on progress of the website and just remember to move cards over which can be a pain.</p>
<p>
Trello: Benefits include:
Minimizing confusion around project assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress.
Customizable lists that allow users to follow metrics they are most interested in and use automated notifications to keep informed of all changes.
Simple collaboration that allows entire teams to participate in important discussions, send notes, share files and comment on individual tasks.</p>

<p><b>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and 
    efficiency </b></p>

<p>The best way to improve productivity and efficiency is to track the time and maybe restrict the time spent on tasks. Try not to multitask, make a habit of committing to a single task and finish it before moving onto your next task. Also do not strive for perfection as the reality is nothing is ever perfect. Try not to waste time chasing this illusion. Put your phone and other distractions are out of eyesight or ear shot because when you are in the zone you don't want to be interrupted, so turn off notifications.Researcher say you should work in 90 minute intervals and they also after 4.5 hours you will be less effective.</p>

<p><b>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects –what would you do differently next time?Use of Slack?</b></p>

<p>As I worked on my own I had no use for Slack but using Trello I was able to effectively keep my productivity at a high level. But if working in a team Slack can be fantastic to share files and communicating with team members</p>
