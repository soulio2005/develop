            While downloading files and viewing websites, you’ll meet up with many file formats. Most are common, and
            encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use. Here, we
            have a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            .AVI | .CSS | .DOC | .EXE | .GIF | .HTML/ .HTM | .JPG/ .JPEG | .MID/ .MIDI | .MP3 | .MPG/ .MPEG | .MOV/ .QT
            | .PDF | .PNG | .RAM | .RAR | .TIFF | .TXT | .WAV | .ZIP | Streaming Media ]
        </p>
        <p>
            .AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved
            Standard video format supported on the windows platform. They do not stream, however, so you have to
            download the entire file before you can watch any of it.
        </p>
        <p>
            .CSS — Cascading StyleSheet
            CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. To read more
            about them.
        </p>
        <p>
            .DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument
            Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across
            loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them.
        </p>
        <p>
            .EXE — EXEcutable file
            If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.

        </p>
        <p>.GIF — Graphics Interchange Format
            The most common image format on the Internet. Good for simple images.

        </p>
        <p>
            .HTML/ .HTM — HyperText Markup Language file
            Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files
        </p>
        <p>
            .JPG/ .JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file
            Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. A
        </p>
        <p>.MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface
            Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They’re usually really small and often sound great,
            although it largely depends on your soundcard. Midi collections are one of the few places in the world where
            you can find classic game and movie music, and for that I salute them.
        </p>
        <p>.MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file
            Single Handedly caused a revolution. MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows
            download-happy file sizes and excellent quality. Has caused much grief for the music industry as songs are
            now small enough to be traded online.

        </p>
        <p>.MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file
            One of the standards for streaming movies.
        </p>
        <p>.MOV/ .QT — QuickTime MOVie
            The QuickTime format was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC
            and is hugely popular.
        </p>
        <p> .PDF — Portable Document Format
            Adobe Acrobat files were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed
            platforms, and still look the exact same, something which can’t be said about HTML files...
        </p>
        <p>.PNG — Portable Network Graphics
            PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport
            advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support. .RAM — Real Audio Movie
            Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats,
            before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that everyone with sense decided to stop
            using their programs.
        </p>
        <p> .RAR — RAR archive
            This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like
            special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files.
        </p>
        <p>.TIFF — Tagged Image File Format
            For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser.
        </p>
        <p>.TXT — TeXT file
            The most basic of files, it’s just some text.
        </p>
        <p>.WAV — WAVe sound file
            A basic, either in- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.
        </p>
        <p>.ZIP — ZIPped file

        </p>
        <p>
            Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads
            will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with.
            Streaming Media
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past few years many new file formats were brought in for the reason of allowing streaming — that
            is, the file starts playing as soon as it begins to be downloaded, and keeps on playing as more of the file
            makes its way to your computer. The hugely successful mp3 quickly became the most popular of these formats.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proprietary RealAudio and RealVideo formats from » Real are popular among multimedia sites, but are
            terrible formats that require a truly horrible piece of software to play. Mpeg, AVI and MP4 video are also
            very popular, and can be played in many programs like Quicktime Player, VLC and Windows Media Player. These
            types of files are most important when embedding multimedia.
