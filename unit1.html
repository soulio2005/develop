        <b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital
            projects to fail? Why?</b>
    </p>



    </p>
    <p>
        Risk is likely in project management , without addressing risk in digital projects specifically. Risk is a
        reality with the likelihood the project could go over-budget,over-time and not giving value and profit.

    </p>
    <p>
        Some examples of risk in a digital project:
        You begin a 6-month long website build project. Two months in, Apple releases a new version of iOS, and the
        site you have in development doesn’t work properly on the new iOS version.
        Halfway through a project, your company merges with another company, which has a very different go-to-market
        strategy.</p>
    <p>
        Three months into a website build project, a competitor releases a new site with a great new feature that
        could draw your customers away.
        A key team member departs your company for another opportunity mid-way through the project.

            1.5Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –how
            do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</b></p>
    <p>>1. Focus on Your Business
        It's crucial to limit distraction when you're getting started—and while software can be a valuable tool, it
        can also be a distraction.Apps are only tools to help you get stuff done. Try to make due with what you have
        for as long as you have, and only get new apps when you really need them.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Analyze Your Needs
        So, once you’re ready to shop for tools, proceed with caution. Make do with Gmail, Google Docs, and other
        lightweight or homegrown solutions until you have identified your pain points and the real needs of your
        team. You might not need new software just yet
    </p>
    <p>3. Do Research
        A simple option is to find out what software companies like yours are using. That feedback will be the most
        objective and relevant to your team, making the tools most likely to do what you need.
    </p>
    <p>6. Customize Apps for Your Needs
        Understanding your own needs and workflows will help you get the most out of your tools. Sometimes you'll
        have to tweak settings to make a tool fit your team's style. Other times, you might need need to use an app
        for a different purpose than it's originally intended for. What matters is getting a tool to fit your needs.
    </p>
    <p>7.Get Everyone Onboard
        If your team won’t use the new app, there’s no point in implementing it. Adoption is critical.

    </p>
    <p>
        8. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

        Communicate about everything regarding your software choice. Tell your team why you picked this app, what
        problem it solves, and how to use it effectively in your work. Perhaps make some internal documentation that
        teaches your team about how to use the app, to make sure everyone's on the same page with it.

        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does
        GDPR impact digital projects?
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://www.superoffice.com/blog/gdpr/">Click here to see the references</a>
        GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation.
    </p>
    <p>
        This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will
        apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including
        companies on other continents.
        What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and
        assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.
        According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a
        photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical
        information, or a computer IP address.
        There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the
        person is the person. Also in a B2B setting, everything is about individuals interacting and sharing
        information with and about each other. Customers in B2B market are obviously companies, but the
        relationships that handle the business topics are people – or individuals.
